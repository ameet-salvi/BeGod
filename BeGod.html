<h1>
Be God!
</h1>
<p>
In the midst of the cranking horns and buzzing metro rails, nights filled with galactic electricity, making one feel no less in living the deep dark universe of glittering stars of luciferian realm. I am not sure where and how I begin to put across the point I see. 
</p>
<p>
So, here I am just punching the keys on my lifeless device ( I doubt ), my only best friend for past few years, hoping that the arrow I am shooting with words lands upon some alive blood rushing ears with open minds, yes, we all still have them.
</p>
<p>
Most of you, those who have known me closely but have not met for several years now, would have developed a persona of me that is occupying some part of the ROM in your brain. Well, things change and all the inconsiderate macho of both, men and women alike slowly fades into the withering body that depreciates its worth in an ever competitive job market. Like all markets, it has its own biases managed by some ancient deep roots that still haunts upon traditional freewill and human abstract. Yes, I have been to the temples, churches and mosques lately seeking some assistance from The God.

<p>
Last few years since the pandemic, I have been struggling hard to find a job. Struggling would only be an understatement, if one can merely realise dying daily and waking up next morning hoping a new ray of hope would land upon you. Leaning on some rental incomes and stock trading provides me the cushion to carry the job hunt. However, there are days of trading losses where debts and family responsibilities hunt you back to a level where euthenasia and suicide seems to be an option even to the best decision making minds in the world that I have spoken to.
</p>
<p>
A thinking mind plays with you in times like these. Sometimes, one feels that the whole state of affairs is weaving a large conspiracy to push you out of the city that you are born into because you donâ€™t support or fall into their vote bank. Sometimes, it is the push of the unrequired expensive upskilling programs that flash and shove themselves down your eyes through your own hand held devices because your earlier education was reserved as free. I did one of it, trust me there is not even a marginal influence or increase of knowledge I had prior to what I already had. Clearly. It was an extortion down the road of job seeking to get yourself hired. I also tried the traditional shouting for help on linked-in but a grim silence bounced back upon me with mere some additions of new contacts much appreciated. As days go by, the gap in my career increases and with that down the probability of getting hired. History tells us that time flies, all that remain down are dust and ashes. 
</p>
<p>
Sooner or later, I know I will land upon a job or maybe a job would find me by some divine intervention but somewhere in between the confluence of these two options, the analyst in me fears the ever increasing high probability of the third option, of the dust and ashes catching up before time. Hence, an advice to those who have the best seat on the drive, who are or were inconsiderate like me when the flag was flying high, No external house of God can help you but you can be God, not only by helping others but by simply cherishing of what you have and the memories of what you had looking over the swirling gizmos of marketing that demeans what you have, in that greater context you can Be God!
